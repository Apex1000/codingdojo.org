  Software developer in Paris, France.

  I discovered the coding dojo with the first group of practitioners in Paris
  where I went on a regular basis from 2006 to 2008. Among many participations,
  I had the idea of the [MasterMind](/kata/Mastermind) that I presented at the
  dojo and in a
  [conference](https://etiennecharignon.github.io/ma-valise-de-programmeur/post/article_79/)
  (in french) with the help of [EmmanuelGaillot](/people/EmmanuelGaillot).
